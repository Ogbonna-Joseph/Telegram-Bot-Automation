Telegram Messenger is a cloud-based instant messaging and voice over IP service. 
You can easily install it in your smartphone (Android and iPhone) or computer (PC, Mac and Linux). 
It is free and without any ads. Telegram allows you to create bots that you can interact with.

“Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. 
Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and inline requests. You control your bots using HTTPS requests to Telegram Bot API“.
The IOT DEV BOARD will interact with the Telegram bot to receive and handle the messages, and send responses.
